Heroes Of Pymoli Data AnalysisI was not able to complete the whole analysis because I ran out of time. This is based on the part I did complete. Out of the 573 unique players 81% of them were male. This perhaps indicates that the game is geared more towards men; an indicator of this is in the  average purchase price by gender. Women are spending less on average than other demographics. Perhaps they don’t like the items that are being offered!An observation that I have that won’t make us generate more revenue but is in line with what happens during someone’s life… Users from Ages 15-25 don’t spend as much money as other groups which makes sense if you think about it… Persons under 15 usually get their money from their parents. People that are older than 25 are usually more stable financially. There were only 6 users that made more than 3 purchases. It would be interesting to know/see what the date range of this was to see if that is good or bad…
